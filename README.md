# SUCHIES-deposit   :  "Historical Semi automatic mapping and Radial analysis

This desposit contains 2 script files (R scripts) and a sample of data for testing:
1) The first script is an a "semi-automatic" extraction of urban class from old maps based on data mining of threshold, it provide a binary raster file and a vector file of urban.
2) The second script perform a radial analysis (center perphery) of urban density using the previous file (urban class raster), it also provide a rescaled application using population data on X Y axis. 
3) The data deposit, contain a historical map (Scan histo 1950, IGN/France), and 2 shapefiles (for data mining, those are points on urban pixel", 1 for reference and the second for validation).
